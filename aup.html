  <p>NINACDN' Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") is provided to give our customers and users a clear understanding of what NINACDN expects of them while using the service. All users of NINACDN' Internet services: those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts, as well as those who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Services, must comply with this AUP and our TOS (Terms of Service). <br /> <br /> <strong>Use of NINACDN's Service constitutes acceptance and agreement to NINACDN' AUP as well as NINACDN' TOS (Terms of Service) </strong><br /> <br /> We support the uncensored flow of information and ideas over the Internet and do not actively monitor subscriber activity under normal circumstances. Similarly, we do not exercise editorial control over the content of any web site, e-mail transmission, newsgroups, or other material created or accessible over or through the services, except for certain proprietary Web sites. However, in accordance with our TOS (Terms of Service), we may remove any materials that, in our sole discretion, may be illegal, may subject us to liability, or which may violate this AUP. NINACDN may cooperate with legal authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or alleged crime or civil wrongdoing. Your violation of this AUP may result in the suspension or immediate termination of either your NINACDN account or other actions as detailed in Section 3 <strong>WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.</strong><br /> <br /> This document is intended to provide a basic understand of NINACDN' Acceptable Use Policy.

<p>NINACDN intends to provide its customers access to everything the Internet has to offer. While NINACDN is firmly committed to the principles of free speech, certain activities that may be damaging to the resources of both NINACDN and the Internet and cannot be permitted under the guise of free speech. The resources of NINACDN and the Internet are limited, and abuse of these resources by one user has a negative impact on the entire community.<br /> <br /> We do not routinely monitor the activity of accounts except for measurements of system utilization and the preparation of billing records. However, in our efforts to promote good citizenship within the Internet community, we will respond appropriately if we become aware of inappropriate use of our service.<br /> <br /> You may not use your dedicated server or virtual site to publish material, which NINACDN determines, at its sole discretion, to be unlawful, indecent, or objectionable. For purposes of this policy, "material" refers to all forms of communications including narrative descriptions, graphics (including photographs, illustrations, images, drawings, logos), executable programs, video recordings, and audio recordings.<br /> <br /> If a NINACDN account is used to violate the Acceptable Use Policy or our TOS, we reserve the right to terminate your service without notice. We prefer to advise customers of inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action; however, flagrant violations of the Acceptable Use Policy will result in immediate termination of service. Our failure to enforce this policy, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of our right to do so at any time.<br /> <br /> As a member of our network community, you must use your Internet access responsibly. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact us via email.<br /> <br /> <strong>VIOLATIONS OF NINACDN' ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY</strong><br /> <br /> The following constitute violations of this AUP:<br /> <br /> <strong>1.

Forgery or impersonation:</strong> Adding, removing, or modifying identifying network header information in an effort to deceive or mislead is prohibited. Attempting to impersonate any person by using forged headers or other identifying information is prohibited. The use of anonymous remailers or nicknames does not constitute impersonation.<br /> <br /> <strong>7. Unsolicited commercial e-mail / Unsolicited bulk e-mail (SPAM):</strong> Use of the NINACDN service to transmit any unsolicited commercial or unsolicited bulk e-mail is expressly prohibited. Violations of this type will result in the immediate termination of the offending NINACDN account.<br /> <br /> <strong>8. Spamvertized Websites:</strong> You may not use the Service to host a site that is advertised in SPAM (a spamvertized site), even if you yourself are not engaged in spamming.<br /> <br /> <strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>BEGINNING IMMEDIATELY,</strong> anyone hosting websites or services on their server that support spammers or cause any of our IP space to be listed in any of the various Spam Databases will have their server immediately removed from our network. The server will not be reconnected until such time that you agree to remove ALL traces of the offending material immediately upon reconnection and agree to allow us access to the server to confirm that all material has been COMPLETELY removed. Severe violations may result in immediate and permanent removal of the server from our network without notice to the customer. Any server guilty of a second violation WILL be immediately and permanently removed from our network without notice.<br /> <br /> <strong>9. E-mail / News Bombing:</strong> Malicious intent to impede another person's use of electronic mail services or news will result in the immediate termination of the offending NINACDN account.<br /> <br /> <strong>10.

Unauthorized access: </strong>Use of the NINACDN service to access, or to attempt to access, the accounts of others, or to penetrate, or attempt to penetrate, security measures of NINACDN' or another entity's computer software or hardware, electronic communications system, or telecommunications system, whether the intrusion results in the corruption or loss of data, is expressly prohibited and the offending NINACDN account is subject to immediate termination.<br /> <br /> <strong>13. Copyright or trademark infringement:</strong> Use of the NINACDN service to transmit any material (direct transfer, by e-mail, uploading, posting, hot linking, directly linking or otherwise) that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights of any third party, including, but not limited to, the unauthorized copying of copyrighted material, the digitization and distribution of photographs from magazines, books, or other copyrighted sources, and the unauthorized transmittal of copyrighted software.<br /> <br /> <strong>14. Collection of personal data: </strong>Use of the NINACDN service to collect, or attempt to collect, personal information about third parties without their knowledge or consent.<br /> <br /> <strong>15. Network disruptions and unfriendly activity:</strong> Use of the NINACDN service for any activity which affects the ability of other people or systems to use NINACDN' Services or the Internet. This includes "denial of service" (DOS) attacks against another network host or individual user. Interference with or disruption of other network users, services or equipment is prohibited. It is the Member's responsibility to ensure that their network is configured in a secure manner. A Subscriber may not, through action or inaction, allow others to use their network for illegal or inappropriate actions. A Subscriber may not permit their network, through action or inaction, to be configured in such a way that gives a third party the capability to use their network in an illegal or inappropriate manner. Unauthorized entry and/or use of another company and/or individual's computer system will result in immediate account termination. NINACDN will not tolerate any subscriber attempting to access the accounts of others, or penetrate security measures of other systems, whether or not the intrusion results in corruption or loss of data.<br /> <br /> <strong>16. Net Send Spam:</strong> The use of the net send utility to send unsolicited bulk communication is prohibited. This technique may result in account suspension or termination. Violations of this policy carry severe penalties, including termination of service.<br /> <br /> <strong>17. Fraud:</strong> Involves a knowing misrepresentation or misleading statement, writing or activity made with the intent that the person receiving it will act upon it.<br /> <br /> <strong>18.

Distribution of Viruses: </strong>Intentional distributions of software that attempts to and/or causes damage, harassment, or annoyance to persons, data, and/or computer systems are prohibited. Such an offense will result in the immediate termination of the offending account. <br /> <br /> <strong>20. Inappropriate Use of Software:</strong> Use of software or any device that would facilitate a continued connection, i.e. pinging, while using NINACDN' services could result in suspension service.<br /> <br /> <strong>21.

Servers found to be connecting to or part of these networks will be immediately removed from our network without notice. The server will not be reconnected to the network until such time that you agree to completely remove any and all traces of the IRC server and agree to let us have access to your server to confirm that the content has been completely removed. Any server guilty of a second violation will result in immediate account termination. <br /> <br /> <strong>24. Peer to Peer Software (File Sharing):</strong> The use of Peer to Peer or file sharing software to permit the sharing, copying or distribution of unauthorized copyrighted material on the NINACDN service is prohibited. Use of such software could result in suspension of service. <br /> <br /> <strong>Security</strong><br /> You are responsible for any misuse of your account, even if the inappropriate activity was committed by a friend, family member, guest, or employee.
