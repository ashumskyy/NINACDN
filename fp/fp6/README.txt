Congratulations for picking the Grand version of Flowplayer!
------------------------------------------------------------

This is your unique Flowplayer distribution. You can now generate
your own license keys. They will validate exclusively with the
flowplayer[.min].js and flowplayer.swf files contained here.

You are in charge of the distribution and generation of license
keys specifically for this release. Included are two scripts -
key-gen.js (JavaScript) and key-gen.py (Python) - containing your
personal key generation algorithm.

Additionally there's key-gen.php which autogenerates the key for
the current host. Try it with the auto.php page on your server!


Key generation script usage
---------------------------

key-gen.js requires nodejs - http://nodejs.org. Download nodejs
from http://nodejs.org/download/ and install. Then, fire up a
terminal, and at the command-line prompt enter:

node key-gen.js mydomain.com [otherdomain.org ...]

If you have a file containing domain names:

node key-gen.js -f filewithdomainnames

Alternatively, if you have python installed, run the key-gen.py
script:

python key-gen.py mydomain.com [otherdomain.org ...]
python key-gen.py -f filewithdomainnames

Help is available via the --help|-h option for both scripts.


Load the Unlimited Flowplayer library
-------------------------------------

Make sure to load the unique Unlimited Flowplayer library from
this distribution:

<script src="//example.com/fp-unlimited/flowplayer.min.js">
</script>


SWF configuration
-----------------

Always set the locations of flowplayer.swf and flowplayerhls.swf
explicitly. The global configuration is a good place:

<script>
flowplayer.set({
    swf: "//example.com/fp-unlimited/flowplayer.swf",
    swfHls: "//example.com/fp-unlimited/flowplayerhls.swf"
});
</script>


Protecting your unlimited license
---------------------------------

Keep the license key generation scripts containing your secret
tokens in a safe place. Do not share or distribute them.

License

You can find the Unlimited License here:

Upgrading
---------

Bugfix upgrades are free. As the compilation of your unique
Flowplayer distribution cannot be automated, please drop us an
email at support@flowplayer.org containing your Flowplayer login
email address, and we will add a new release to your Flowplayer
account.

When you deploy an upgrade you have to re-generate the license
keys with the scripts pertaining to the upgrade package.
